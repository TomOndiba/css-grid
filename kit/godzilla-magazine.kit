			<h2 hidden>Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				Repeat compulsion, that old workhorse of the psychology business, sees a patient experiencing the same trauma ad nauseam until it either dulls itself down or grows to dominate his entire life. How else, then, to introduce the Godzilla franchise, which has permitted nearly six decades’ worth of Japanese movie lovers – mostly children – to witness the obliteration of Tokyo over and over again? Godzilla – or, by his original name, Gojira, a portmanteau of the Japanese words for “whale” and “gorilla” – was originally a sharply polemical response to American militarism during and after World War II. The beast was conceived by Ishirō Honda, director of the monster’s 1954 debut and godfather of the kaiju (giant monster) genre, who spent the War’s last year as a prisoner of the Chinese. Legend has it that he was driven through the firebombed ruins of Tokyo, agog at the vastness of its devastation. As a response to such an atrocity, the images in Godzilla didn’t just evoke the ashes of Japan’s great cities, they replicated them on a harrowingly convincing scale.

			<h2>Godzilla: Final Wars</h2>

			<p>
				Released 3 years into the post 9/11 world, Godzilla: Final Wars had the chance to draw a parallel between the post-nuclear anxiety found in the 1954 original and the current quest for those ever-elusive weapons of mass destruction. Instead, Final Wars is less a product of its origins than a hyperactive sum of its incarnations.

			<h2>Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.</h2>
			<p>
				The film ends with a close-up shot of a vial of Godzilla’s genetic material, secured in a lab at some undisclosed location. On the surface, the image functions as a teaser for future installments of monster mayhem, but with all of the hand-wringing ambivalence that attends Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S., the shot feels more like a provocation—who dares to take up the burden of this franchise next?
